## Introduction

This repository accompanies the paper "AI-Driven Disease Risk Stratification: Tackling the Challenge of Complex Confounders to Enable Precision-Medicine." This repository implements MultiRiskNet for multiclass prediction of disease risk from EHR trajectories. The code is based on the repository https://github.com/BrunakSanderLabs/CancerRiskNet, which contains the code implementation used for the paper [A deep learning algorithm to predict risk of pancreatic cancer from disease trajectories](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02332-5).
